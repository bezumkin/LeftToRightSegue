## "Left to Right" Segue

This is not "real" Lefto to Right segue, this is just a trick.

For example, we have two windows: Main and Info. And we want to segue Info window from left to right.

The main idea is to use the **standard** show segue and his invisible activate when opening the Info window. So we moving to Main window and can unwind segue from left by taping the button.

Once again - it is just a trick, but working good!
